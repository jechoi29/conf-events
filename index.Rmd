## Building a Conference Events Graph

In this text, I explore making a graph about things that happened to me at a conference. Those things include:

```{r cars, echo = FALSE}
kable(conf_events)
```

## Starting to Make Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
scale_x <- scale_x_continuous(
  name = "",
  limits = c(0, 1),
  breaks = .5,
  labels = "Truly Excruciating",
  sec.axis = dup_axis(labels = "Genuinely Awesome")
)

scale_y <- scale_y_continuous(
  name = "",
  limits = c(0, 1),
  breaks = 0.5,
  labels = "Industry",
  sec.axis = dup_axis(labels = "Academic")
)

basic_chart <- ggplot(data = conf_events)

final_chart <- basic_chart +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = category, y = scenario, label = label)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = .5) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = .5) +
  scale_y +
  scale_x

ggplotly(final_chart)
```
